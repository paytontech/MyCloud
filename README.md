# MyCloud
MyCloud is an open-source reverse engineering of Apple's iCloud that's built to be run on a home server (Raspberry Pi, Linux, Windows & macOS (for some reason)) <br>
**THIS IS VERY WORK IN PROGRESS. I LITERALLY DO NOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO MAKE IOS DEVICES COMMUNICATE WITH THIS (maybe some sort of DNS thing??)** Any help is appreciated
