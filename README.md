# MyCloud
MyCloud is an open-source reverse engineering of Apple's iCloud that's built to be run on a home server (Raspberry Pi, Linux, Windows & macOS (for some reason)) <br>
**THIS IS VERY WORK IN PROGRESS. I LITERALLY DO NOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO MAKE IOS DEVICES COMMUNICATE WITH THIS (maybe some sort of DNS thing??)** Any help is appreciated
<br>
### Planned features (in order of priority)
- [ ] Native iOS & macOS support (likely will be done with some DNS thing)
- [ ] iCloud storage 
- [ ] iCloud backup
- [ ] iCloud+ Features (hide my email, maybe private relay? (though private relay may be beyond the scope of this project))
